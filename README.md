### Papi - A PHP API library

Some useful functionality for quick and dirty JSON API serving with PHP.

This example defines an API for the figlet ascii art generator in /public/api.php
and a frontend for it in /public/index.html and /public/js/figlet.js.

Requires figlet `brew install figlet` and probably tweaks to the figlet font path
in /public/api.php
